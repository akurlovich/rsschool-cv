####About me
I want to **radically change my workplace**. I have successfully completed an ***internship*** and the *“Software Testing”* and *“Software Testing. Professional level”* courses of BELHARD Academy. My teaсher thinks I have good knowledge in Software Testing, SDLS and STLC,  so I can develop plans and procedures for testing, preparing test documentation using TestRail and tracking defects in JIRA.    

During the internship I wrote *Test cases and Bug reports*, did *Black box, Functional, Cross-browser, Web, GUI, API, Mobile and Regression tests*. 
We worked on the ***SCRAM methodology***.

At my current job position, I face every day with different tasks from customers and suppliers also from co-workers of other departments, so I can tell that I am good at  ***teamwork*** and ***problem solving***.      

**Personal qualities:** setting and fulfilling difficult and new purpose in life, sagacity, responsibility, thoroughness, perseverance.
**Hobbies:** Learning technical literature, fishing, auto mechanics.
